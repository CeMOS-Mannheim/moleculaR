\title{Normalize Intensity}
\usage{
normalizeIntensity(x, method, meanMethod = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{x:}{a list of \code{MassPeaks} objects.}

\item{method:}{the normalization method,  has to be one of c('medianFoldChange', 'RMS', 'TIC', 'median').}

\item{meanMethod:}{only used for `medianFoldChange` normalization. See
\code{?MALDIquant::mergeMassPeaks} for more info.}
}
\value{
Intensity-normalized list of \code{MassPeaks} objects.
}
\description{
This normalizes spectral intensities based on a number of different methods. such that for every spectrum a median
fold-change of peak intensities is calculated with reference to the mean spectrum
which is then taken as a normalization factor for that particular spectrum.
}
\details{
The `medianFoldChange` normalization is done such that for every spectrum a median
fold-change of peak intensities is calculated with reference to the mean spectrum
which is then taken as a normalization factor for that particular spectrum (see
reference [1]). The `RMS`, `TIC` and `median` normalization methods are
equivalent to their counterparts in other packages (ex. MALDIquant), they are
just adapted to process centroided data of `MassPeak` Objects. Note that for
`medianFoldChange` normalization, it is important to run peak binning beforehand.
