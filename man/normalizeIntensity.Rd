\title{Normalize Intensity}
\usage{
normalizeIntensity(x, method, meanMethod = "mean", mz = NULL, tol = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x:}{a list of \code{MassPeaks} objects.}

\item{method:}{the normalization method,  has to be one of
c('medianFoldChange', 'RMS', 'TIC', 'median', 'IS').}

\item{meanMethod:}{only used for `medianFoldChange` normalization. See
\code{?MALDIquant::mergeMassPeaks} for more info.}

\item{mz:}{a numeric, the m/z value of the internal standard (IS) -
only relevant for `method='IS'`.}

\item{tol:}{a numeric, the absolute tolerance for m/z (in Da) -
only relevant for `method='IS'`.}
}
\value{
Intensity-normalized list of \code{MassPeaks} objects.
}
\description{
This normalizes spectral intensities based on a number of different methods.
}
\details{
The `medianFoldChange` normalization is done such that for every spectrum a median
fold-change of peak intensities is calculated with reference to the mean spectrum
which is then taken as a normalization factor for that particular spectrum (see
reference [1]). The `RMS`, `TIC` and `median` normalization methods are
equivalent to their counterparts in other packages (ex. MALDIquant), they are
just adapted to process centroided data of `MassPeak` Objects. Note that for
`medianFoldChange` normalization, it is important to run peak binning beforehand.
The `IS` method assumes the presence of an internal standard at `mz` m/z against
which all intensities are normalized (pixel-wise).
