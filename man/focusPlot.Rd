\title{Plot a spectrum focusing on a specific mass-range}
\usage{
focusPlot(x, m, fwhm, sigmalim = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of type `MassPeaks` or `MassSpectrum`. Either a single
spectrum or a mean spectrum (see `?MALDIquant::mergeMassPeaks`).}

\item{m}{a numeric, the m/z value at which to do the plotting.}

\item{fwhm}{a numeric, the fwhm at `m`, normally generated by `getFwhm`.}

\item{sigmalim}{an integer, how many sigmas (of the calculated Gaussian)
around `m` should be considered in the plot. Note that the superimposed
Gaussian always spans `m Â± sigma`.}
}
\value{
a plot.
}
\description{
This function plots a spectrum (`MassPeaks` or `MassSpectrum`) and provides
a focus on a mass range around a given m/z of interest taking into
consideration the fwhm at that mass.
