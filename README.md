## moleculaR: Spatial Probabilistic Mapping of Metabolite Ensembles in Mass Spectrometry Imaging


The moleculaR R package provides a computational framework that introduces probabilistic mapping
and point-for-point statistical testing of metabolites in tissue via Mass spectrometry imaging.
It enables collective molecular projections and consequently spatially-resolved investigation
of ion milieus, lipid pathways or user-defined biomolecular ensembles within the same image.

MoleculaR comes pre-loaded with the [SwissLipids database](https://www.swisslipids.org) and with is capable of importing metabolite annotation results from the [METASPACE platform](https://metaspace2020.eu/) to compute FDR-verified molecular probability maps (MPMs) and collective projection probability maps (CPPMs). moleculaR could also be deployed and hosted on a centralized server and is equipped with a web-based GUI based on [shiny](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/shiny/versions/1.7.1). 

For more information about this package and its applications please refer to the associated paper (doi).
